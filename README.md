# George Shields' Resume 
This webpage will serve as a more detailed version of my resume. It contains more information than what is given in my PDF file that I submit to employers. I decided to make this because I wanted to be able to add more information about me that might interest potential employers and so that I can give recruiters/hiring managers an opportunity to reach out to me directly through this webpage if they desire. 

As I continue working on this project, I plan to expand it out into a more sophisticated web application, offering more than basic webpages. I intend to add more content about me that I do not have space for in the resume I send out for job applications.
